This project is my attempt to change mindset in the Oceanographic Community at large and get them to use Bayesian methods. The Ocean is a noisy place.  Frequentism will never cut it here because: No integration of background knowledge, un-principled, arbitrary, and uses the wrong probability to boot. I target Satellite Oceanographers here because they also have to contend with the atmosphere between the ocean and their instruments. 
This is also a first stab at developing a Bayesian Workflow at promulgated by Bayesians like Betancourt, Gelman, Hill, etc. They propose a general framework; the reality in the marine environment will probably impose constraints not visible at Columbia. I am aware of at least one paper on the Bayesian Workflow for ecology.
